Hello! Having recently learned of an open \jobName{} \jobType{} at \empName{}, I was compelled to contact you right away and express in words my strong interest in this position. I love what I've seen of your culture and goals at \empName{}, and I'd be delighted to learn more and see what I can bring to your team. 

%Also, I'm a St. Louis native, and I respect any business that keeps it local.

In addition to my \textbf{attached resume}, I thought it would be prudent to provide for you a brief overview of my \textbf{background and qualifications}. I believe that in this \jobName{} \jobType{} I could make a skilled, reliable, and enthusiastic addition to the \empName{} team. I offer the following career highlights to support my candidacy:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\color{accent}Five Years}' history of \textbf{\color{accent}Mathematics and Statistics}, including experience in \textbf{advanced calculus, linear algebra, and computational statistical methods}, plus software including \textbf{R, SPSS, and Python}.
    \item \textbf{\color{accent}Four Years} of experience in \textbf{\color{accent}Data Analysis, Data Visualization, \& Machine Learning}, using \textbf{R \& Python} in addition to platforms like \textbf{Tableau and IBM SPSS}, plus a history of interest in statistics education and the use of analytical and machine learning tools to \textbf{tell stories from data}.
    \item \textbf{\color{accent}Four Years} of \textbf{\color{accent}Web Development} experience using both raw code and \textbf{CMS services} such as Wordpress, Wix, and Squarespace. This includes self-hosted sites on LAMP server stacks running Wordpress and \textbf{HTML, CSS, and JavaScript}, plus several projects also utilizing \textbf{PHP \& mySQL}.
    %\item %\textbf{\color{accent}Three Years} of experience in \textbf{\color{accent}Psychology and Neuroscience Academic Research}, spanning several labs and areas of study, including EEG signal processing and Event Related Potential research, Animal Neurophysiology and Behavior Research, and Applied and Industrial/Organizational Psychology Research.

    \item \textbf{\color{accent}One Year} of experience in \textbf{\color{accent}Professional Business Consulting} This includes practical experience with \textbf{survey design and methodology}, in addition to public and private \textbf{program evaluation}.
    \item \textbf{\color{accent}One Year} of experience in \textbf{\color{accent}Software Development}, comprising of algorithm and data structure coursework and programming languages such as \textbf{x86, C, C++, Java, Python, PHP, and JavaScript}.
    \item \textbf{\color{accent}One Year} of coursework with \textbf{\color{accent}Relational Database Systems}, specifically \textbf{mySQL and SQL Server}.
    \item \textbf{\color{accent}One Year} of experience with \textbf{\color{accent}Deep Learning}, including the mathematics and implementation of \textbf{Convolutional Neural Networks} and other methods utilizing relevant \textbf{Python libraries}, most notably \textbf{TensorFlow}.
\end{itemize}

Much of the experience I have gained can be represented by the projects I have completed, many of which can be found online. I have prepared a few samples of that work for your perusal in these \textbf{clickable links}:\\\medskip

\makebox[0.33\linewidth][c]{\textbf{\color{accent}\href{http://www.aeholbrook.com}{My Photography Portfolio}}}

\setlength{\parindent}{1.5em}

With regards to my skill history, much of my previous work has involved experiment design and implementation as a research assistant and client negotiation and interaction as a research consultant. Much of this work involved \textbf{surveys}, \textbf{public data}, \textbf{time series analyses}, and other means of measurement, analyzed using \textbf{R}, \textbf{Python}, and \textbf{IBM SPSS}. I have also built a number of \textbf{web scrapers} and \textbf{machine learning} models in multiple languages for a number of \textbf{data projects}. I would be thrilled to find opportunities to apply these skills at your company.

%As briefly mentioned above, I also possess experience working with multiple labs performing research on various topics in neuroscience and psychology. I performed extensive \textbf{data cleanup} and maintained \textbf{data pipelines} in these roles, and even helped streamline an EEG pipeline at one lab by proactively facilitating a move from on-site hardware to processing within the school's supercomputer, making slight adjustments to the hardware within.

Additionally, I possess \textbf{demonstrated strengths} in communication, leadership, and problem solving. While I am early on my professional journey, I am confident that my background as a self-starter and my strong interest in the field will make me a valuable candidate. In gaining these skills in this \jobType{} as \empName{} implements them, I am confident I will become a stronger asset for the team. 


Finally, I want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to you at \empName{} for considering my application and taking the time to read through my information. For more information, please feel free to contact me. I happily welcome the opportunity to speak with you and the team at your earliest convenience and I \textbf{am very grateful} for your time and consideration.
