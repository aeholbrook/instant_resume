% CUSTOM-COMMANDS.STY - Semantic Markup System for Professional Resume Consistency
%
% This package provides a comprehensive semantic markup system that separates
% content from presentation, making it easy to maintain consistent formatting
% across your entire CV while allowing for easy style changes.
%
% PHILOSOPHY:
% Instead of using raw LaTeX formatting commands throughout your CV content,
% this package provides meaningful, semantic commands that describe WHAT
% something is, not HOW it should look. This makes your CV:
% - More maintainable (change styles in one place)
% - More consistent (impossible to accidentally use different formatting)
% - More adaptable (easily create different versions for different industries)
%
% STRUCTURE OVERVIEW:
% 1. Core semantic markup commands (technologies, roles, companies, etc.)
% 2. Content structure helpers (achievements, tech stacks)
% 3. Domain-specific terminology (payment industry terms)
% 4. Conditional formatting system (technical vs. business focus)
% 5. Draft and debugging helpers
% 6. Measurement and metrics formatting
% 7. Common abbreviations and acronyms

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% SECTION 1: CORE SEMANTIC MARKUP COMMANDS
% These commands provide semantic meaning to different types of content in your CV
% They answer the question "WHAT is this content?" not "HOW should it look?"
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% TECHNOLOGY AND SKILLS MARKUP
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% \tech{} - Mark up technology names and technical terms
% Philosophy: Technologies should be readable but not overly emphasized
% Usage: \tech{Python}, \tech{AWS}, \tech{Kubernetes}
% Current styling: No special formatting (normal text)
% Can easily be changed to italic, bold, or colored text
\newcommand{\tech}[1]{#1}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% \role{} - Mark up job titles and professional roles
% Philosophy: Job titles are the most important part of work experience entries
% Usage: \role{Senior Software Engineer}, \role{Technical Lead}

% The em-dash (--) provides visual separation between role and company
\newcommand{\role}[1]{\large\textbf{#1} --}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% ORGANIZATION MARKUP

% \company{} - Mark up company and organization names
% Philosophy: Company names should be visible but secondary to job roles
% Usage: \company{Google}, \company{Microsoft}, \company{Startup Inc.}
% Current styling: Small text, grouped to contain the size change
% The grouping {{ }} ensures the size change doesn't affect surrounding text
\newcommand{\company}[1]{{\small #1}}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% PROJECT AND ACHIEVEMENT MARKUP
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% \project{} - Mark up project names and initiatives
% Philosophy: Project names should be distinguished from regular text

% \achievement{} - Format achievement and accomplishment descriptions
% Philosophy: Achievements need consistent formatting and spacing
% Usage: \achievement{Built monitoring system that reduced downtime by 50\%}
% Current styling: Smaller italic text with themed caret icon and tighter spacing
% The \relsize{-1.0} makes text slightly smaller, themed caret provides visual emphasis
% Added hanging indent so wrapped lines don't go back to left margin
\newcommand{\achievement}[1]{%
  \vspace{0.25\baselineskip}% Reduced vertical spacing (was \smallskip)
  \hangindent=1.5em% Indent wrapped lines
  \hangafter=1% Start hanging indent after first line
  {\color{MarkerColour!80!black}\small\faCaretRight}\space\emph{\relsize{-1.0}\kerneddot #1}% Themed caret with slightly smaller font
  \vspace{0.1\baselineskip}% Minimal space after
}
