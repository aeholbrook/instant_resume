\newcommand*\circled[1]{\tikz[baseline=(char.base)]{
   % Create a TikZ node with circular shape
   \node[
     shape=circle,                              % Make it perfectly circular
     text=white,                               % White text for contrast

% SECTION 10: CURVE CLASS CUSTOMIZATION
% Modifications to the curve document class for professional CV appearance
% The curve class provides CV-specific commands like \rubric and \entry
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Value of 1 means no scaling (use original size)
\headerscale{1}

% \Large: Larger font size for prominence
% \bfseries: Bold weight for emphasis
% \sffamily: Sans-serif font family for modern appearance
\rubricfont{\Large\bfseries\sffamily}

% Rubric spacing controls - fine-tune the vertical spacing around section headers
\setlength{\rubricspace}{6pt}        % Space before section header
\setlength{\rubricafterspace}{-18pt} % Space after section header (negative = tighter)
\setlength{\subrubricspace}{2pt}     % Space before subsection headers
\setlength{\subrubricbeforespace}{2pt} % Space after subsection headers

  \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline]%                 % Start TikZ drawing
    % Create gradient line from SwishLineColour to white
    \shade[left color=SwishLineColour!60!white, right color=white] rectangle (12cm,2.5pt);
    % Place the section title text over the line
    \node[
      font={\large\bfseries\sffamily},           % Large, bold, sans-serif
      inner sep=0pt,                             % No internal padding
      anchor=south west,                         % Position anchor point
      text depth=.5ex,                           % Consistent text depth
      text height=1.5ex                          % Consistent text height
