% CUSTOM-COMMANDS.STY - Semantic Markup System for Professional Resume Consistency
%
% This package provides a comprehensive semantic markup system that separates
% content from presentation, making it easy to maintain consistent formatting
% across your entire CV while allowing for easy style changes.
%
% PHILOSOPHY:
% Instead of using raw LaTeX formatting commands throughout your CV content,
% this package provides meaningful, semantic commands that describe WHAT
% something is, not HOW it should look. This makes your CV:
% - More maintainable (change styles in one place)
% - More consistent (impossible to accidentally use different formatting)
% - More adaptable (easily create different versions for different industries)
%
% STRUCTURE OVERVIEW:
% 1. Core semantic markup commands (technologies, roles, companies, etc.)
% 2. Content structure helpers (achievements, tech stacks)
% 3. Domain-specific terminology (payment industry terms)
% 4. Conditional formatting system (technical vs. business focus)
% 5. Draft and debugging helpers
% 6. Measurement and metrics formatting
% 7. Common abbreviations and acronyms

% SECTION 1: CORE SEMANTIC MARKUP COMMANDS
% These commands provide semantic meaning to different types of content in your CV

\newcommand{\achievement}[1]{%
  \vspace{0.25\baselineskip}% Reduced vertical spacing (was \smallskip)
  {\color{MarkerColour!80!black}\small\faCaretRight}\space\emph{\relsize{-1.0}\kerneddot #1}% Themed caret with slightly smaller font
